# Database Project – SQL Scripts  

## About the Project  
This project contains SQL scripts related to *database schema design, CRUD operations testing, and stress testing* to ensure the database's *functionality, efficiency, and scalability*.  

## Project Objectives  
- *Database Schema Design:* Define tables, relationships, and constraints.  
- *CRUD Operations Testing:* Validate Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.  
- *Stress Testing:* Analyze performance under high-load conditions.  

## SQL Files Overview  

### 1. *Project.sql*  
- Defines the *database schema*, including table structures, data types, primary keys, and foreign key relationships.  
- Ensures database normalization and integrity.  
- Example tables:  
  - Users  
  - Products  
  - Orders  
  - Transactions  

### 2. *Project_crud_test.sql*  
- Implements *CRUD operations* to validate database functionality.  
- Includes:  
  - *CREATE* – Adding new records to tables.  
  - *READ* – Fetching data using SELECT queries.  
  - *UPDATE* – Modifying existing records.  
  - *DELETE* – Removing data securely.  
- Helps in verifying *data consistency and error handling*.  

### 3. *Stress_testing.sql*  
- Contains queries to *simulate high-load scenarios* and evaluate database performance.  
- Includes:  
  - *Bulk Inserts* – Testing large data ingestion.  
  - *Complex Joins* – Checking query optimization.  
  - *Concurrent Transactions* – Simulating multiple users.  
- Helps assess *query execution time, indexing efficiency, and database bottlenecks*.  

## Technologies Used  
- *SQL Database Management System (DBMS):* MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server (Specify the one used)  
- *Testing Tools:* SQL Benchmarking, Performance Logs  

## Key Takeaways  
- *Well-structured database schema* enhances data integrity.  
- *CRUD validation* ensures smooth user interactions.  
- *Stress testing* highlights performance improvements.
